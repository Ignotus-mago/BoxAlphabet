# BoxAlphabet
 A minimalist all-caps alphabet to use with IgnoCodeLib.

You will need IgnoCodeLib, a Processing Contributed Library, which is available in the  Processing 3 distribution (Sketch menu > Import Library... > Add Library...). You can also access it here: http://paulhertz.net/ignocodelib/.
