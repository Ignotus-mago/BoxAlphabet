# BoxAlphabet
 A minimalist all-caps graphic alphabet to use with IgnoCodeLib. Outputs to Adobe Illustrator, PDF, and SVG file format. The .ai file includes groups and layers.

Sample AI, SVG and PDF files are included to show you what output looks like.

You will need IgnoCodeLib, a Processing Contributed Library, which is available in the  Processing 3 distribution (Sketch menu > Import Library... > Add Library...). You can also access it here: http://paulhertz.net/ignocodelib/. For no reason I know it has disappeared from the Processing Contributed Libraries page.
